## Introduction

Solarly leverages machine learning algorithms to predict the stability of perovskite materials based on their chemical composition. Perovskites are of significant interest in solar cell technology due to their unique properties, and accurately predicting their stability is crucial for efficient solar cell design and fabrication.

This repository contains the code for the Solarly web application, including both the front-end and back-end components necessary for deploying the machine learning model.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Solarly provides an intuitive interface for users to input the chemical composition of perovskite materials.
- **Real-Time Prediction**: Utilizing a trained machine learning model, Solarly delivers real-time predictions regarding the stability of perovskite materials.

## Technologies Used

Solarly is built using the following technologies:

- Python
- Flask
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- HTML/CSS

## Usage

To use Solarly, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the [Solarly website](https://predict-solar-cell-materials.onrender.com/).
2. Click on the "Predict" tab in the navigation bar.
3. Input the chemical composition of the perovskite material.
